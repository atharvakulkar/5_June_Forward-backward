        "2. **Exploding Gradients**:\n",
        "   - **Issue**: Gradients become very large, causing instability and divergent learning.\n",
        "   - **Solution**: Apply gradient clipping, use more stable activation functions, or initialize weights appropriately.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Overfitting**:\n",
        "   - **Issue**: Model performs well on training data but poorly on validation/test data.\n",
        "   - **Solution**: Use regularization techniques (dropout, L2 regularization), and apply early stopping.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Slow Convergence**:\n",
        "   - **Issue**: Training process takes a long time to converge.\n",
        "   - **Solution**: Use adaptive learning rate optimizers (Adam, RMSprop), and ensure proper normalization of inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Incorrect Gradients**:\n",
        "   - **Issue**: Errors in the computation of gradients due to bugs in implementation.\n",
        "   - **Solution**: Validate gradients with gradient checking, use automatic differentiation libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary:\n",
        "Challenges in backward propagation like vanishing/exploding gradients, overfitting, slow convergence, and incorrect gradients can be addressed through techniques such as proper activation functions, gradient clipping, regularization, adaptive learning rates, and gradient checking."
